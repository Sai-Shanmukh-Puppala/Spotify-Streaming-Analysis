# ðŸŽµ Spotify Music Streaming Dashboard 

## Overview
This project analyzes my **personal Spotify streaming history** using an interactive **Power BI dashboard**. It focuses on year-specific trends, such as **top artists**, **favourite tracks**, **streaming frequency**, and identifying periods when I streamed music offline (usually while travelling). The dashboard combines data visualization and storytelling to uncover insights into how my listening habits evolved over the years.

---

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project were:
- To analyze **year-specific streaming trends**, including favorite artists and tracks.
- To visualize **monthly and yearly patterns** in streaming frequency.
- To identify periods of **offline streaming**, particularly during travel.
- To calculate and visualize an **Enjoyment Index**, a metric that reflects listening satisfaction.

---

## Dataset
The data was exported from Spotify's **Streaming History** files and contained:
- **Track Name**: Name of the song played.
- **Artist Name**: The performer or band associated with the track.
- **ms_played**: Duration the track was played, in milliseconds.
- **Date and Time**: Timestamp of when the track was played.
- **Offline/Online Mode**: Whether the streaming occurred online or offline.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
Key transformations performed on the data:
1. Converted `ms_played` into **hours** for better readability.
2. Extracted **Year** and **Month** from timestamps for time-based analysis.
3. Created calculated fields and measures, such as:
   - **Total Playtime**: Aggregated playtime for tracks, artists, and time periods.
   - **Play Count**: Count of how many times each track or artist was played.
   - **Enjoyment Index**: Ratio of playtime to skips to measure engagement.
   - **Offline Stream Time**: Aggregated streaming time during offline playback.
